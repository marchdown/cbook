What was ANSI like back in 1978? In 1983? What’s it like now?
How did C++ rise through the ranks? What was the relationship between Swedish academia and American enterprise back then?

What was DEC PDP-11 like?

Ooh, there’s  http://aiju.de/code/pdp11/faq
and it runs AS.

**Ahem**. 

Is Go a spiritual successor to C? Can it be used as a middle ground when working with disassembly_reversing_shellcode/handcrafting binary?

What is the canonical way to learn Go, and what is the _best_ canonical way to learn programming language X across all Xs?

Is [A Tour of Go](https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1) **it**?

Go makes packages and mandatory and the standard library itself it being dealt with through imports.

There’s also Goroutines. How central are they to the philosophy of Go?

`main` is **untyped** which, among other things, suggests that the C people back then did not think too much about types and type signatures. This is a step towards duck typing.

Standard library has already been abstracted into an `#import`ed <stdio.h> I wonder how large was it back then and how large is it now.
